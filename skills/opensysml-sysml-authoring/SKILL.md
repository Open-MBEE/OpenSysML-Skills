description: Write SysML v2 / KerML textual notation that OpenSysML accepts and can execute — packages, imports from the bundled standard library, part/attribute/port definitions and usages, defaults vs fixed values, constraints, requirements with bound subjects, actions, states and calculations — and fix the diagnostics `sysml -validate` reports. Use when generating or editing .sysml/.kerml files for OpenSysML, when a model fails to analyse cleanly, or when a value evaluates to <undetermined> or <unset>.

# Authoring SysML v2 for OpenSysML

OpenSysML implements the OMG SysML v2 / KerML 1.1 textual notation. Validate every edit
with `sysml -validate FILE` (exit `0` clean, `2` errors; see `opensysml-cli`) and read the
first diagnostic first. `sysml -validate -strict` additionally rejects notation the OMG
grammars do not admit; use it when the file must also load in other tools.

## Skeleton that validates and runs

```sysml
package Vehicles {
    private import ScalarValues::*;          // Real, Integer, Boolean, String
    private import ISQ::*;                   // quantity kinds such as MassValue
    private import SI::*;                    // units such as kg, m

    part def Wheel { attribute diameter : Real; }

    part def Car {
        attribute mass : Real default = 1200.0;   // `default =` lets usages override
        part wheels : Wheel[4];
        constraint massLimit { mass < 1500.0 }
        requirement def MassReq {
            subject c : Car;
            require constraint { c.mass < 1500.0 }
        }
    }

    part myCar : Car { attribute :>> mass = 1300.0; }   // redefine the default
    requirement massReq : Car::MassReq;                 // a usage is what `satisfy` targets
    satisfy massReq by myCar;                           // binds the subject
}
```

```bash
sysml -validate vehicle.sysml
sysml -e 'Vehicles::myCar.mass' vehicle.sysml          # = 1300.0
sysml -constraint Vehicles::Car::massLimit vehicle.sysml
sysml -satisfy vehicle.sysml      # ✓ satisfy massReq by myCar holds (on Vehicles::myCar ID: 1)
```

## Rules the checker enforces that trip generated models

- **`=` is fixed, `default =` is overridable.** `attribute mass : Real = 1200.0;` on a
  definition cannot be redefined with `:>> mass = ...` in a usage; the diagnostic says
  "cannot override the binding value ... write it as `default =`". Use `default =` on
  definitions, `=` on the usage that pins the value.
- **Imports are per package.** `ScalarValues::Real` is not visible until the package
  (or an enclosing one) imports `ScalarValues::*` or qualifies the name. Unresolved names
  report `unresolved reference: X — did you mean ...?` with stdlib suggestions.
- **One file does not see another.** Pass every dependent file to `sysml`, or put the
  model under one directory and pass the directory. Two files that both declare a root
  `package A` are distinct packages, not a merge.
- **Requirements need a subject.** `-requirement` on a requirement def with an unbound
  `subject` reports `not covered` (exit `2`). Declare a usage beside the parts
  (`requirement r : R;`), assert `satisfy r by part;` (`satisfy` targets a usage, not a
  def) and check it with `-satisfy`; `-requirement r` alone still sees no subject. The
  usage must be reachable as a plain feature from the `satisfy` — declaring it inside the
  part def and writing `satisfy Car::r` fails with "Must be an accessible feature".
- **Running behavior on an object needs the object.** `-action`/`-state 'Name object'`
  report `no instance of ...` unless the same command also passes `-instantiate object`.
- **Multiplicities are checked on instantiation.** `part wheels : Wheel[4]` instantiates
  four wheels; `[1..*]` with no usage yields a multiplicity diagnostic on `-validate=OBJ`.
- **Names with spaces or punctuation** are quoted with single quotes in the model
  (`part 'SA-506' : Stage;`) and on the command line (`-instantiate "Pkg::'SA-506'"`).
- **Values**: `<undetermined>` means the expression depends on something unbound (an
  attribute with neither value nor default, an input parameter), `<unset>` means the
  feature exists but has no value. Give defaults or bind on the usage.
- **Real literals**: `1500` is an `Integer`; comparing an `Integer` literal with a `Real`
  attribute works, but `1500.0` keeps the type explicit. The opt-in lint
  `rounded-real-literal` warns about literals that cannot be represented exactly.
- **Units and quantities**: `attribute mass : MassValue = 1300 [kg];` requires importing
  `ISQ::*` and `SI::*`. Arithmetic across incompatible quantity kinds is rejected.

## Behavior that the runtime executes

```sysml
package Mission {
    private import ScalarValues::*;
    part def Rover {
        attribute battery : Real default = 100.0;
        action def Drive { in distance : Real; }
        action drive : Drive;
        state def Modes {
            entry; then Idle;
            state Idle;
            state Driving;
            transition Idle_to_Driving first Idle accept Go then Driving;
            transition Driving_to_Idle first Driving accept Stop then Idle;
        }
        exhibit state modes : Modes;
    }
    attribute def Go; attribute def Stop;   // signals are attribute defs accepted by transitions
    part rover1 : Rover;
}
```

```bash
sysml -instantiate Mission::rover1 -state 'Mission::Rover::Modes Mission::rover1' -advance 5 mission.sysml
sysml -instantiate Mission::rover1 -action 'Mission::Rover::Drive Mission::rover1' mission.sysml
```

- Actions run to completion; `-check-*` flags explore every schedule. State machines
  take their initial transition and then wait for events; send them with the REPL's
  `%send Go to rover1` or drive time with `-advance`.
- Calculations: `calc def Range { in battery : Real; return : Real = battery * 2.0; }`
  invoked as `sysml -calc 'Mission::Range(50.0)'`.
- Constraints in a `constraint def` take `in` parameters; a `constraint` usage inside a
  part reads the part's features directly, as `massLimit` above does.

## Lints that stay warnings

`undeclared-signal` (a transition accepts a type never sent), `port-type-mismatch`,
`deferred-keeper-unmarked`, and `nonstandard-notation` (becomes an error under `-strict`).
Silence one deliberately with `-disable-lint NAME` and say why in the model's documentation.

## Checking your own work

```bash
sysml -validate model.sysml && sysml -json -validate model.sysml | python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["status"])'
```
For larger models open the REPL (`opensysml-repl`): `%load model.sysml`, then `%search`,
`%instantiate`, `%features`, `%eval` to inspect before committing changes.
